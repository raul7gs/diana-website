      Using a standard data model enables the development of processes and algorithms that can automatically generate visualizations for specific parts of the data structure,
        following predefined templates and ensuring rapid execution.

    <p>
        In DIANA, this standard is the <em><a href="https://dlr-sl.github.io/cpacs-website/">
                        CPACS (Common Parametric Aircraft Configuration Schema)</a></em>, which has been developed at DLR over the past 20 years. More details and documentation are available on the CPACS website.
